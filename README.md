# Star-Friend

This is a small solo project that I made in order to be more comfortable with programming and mostly to see how well I could make a game completely on my own.
The goal is a simple and friendly game that revolves around a star making friends and growing thanks to those friendships. 

Searching across the universe for a wide variety of friends, there are both incredible and dangerous things to find, so this adventure is going to be a relaxing thrill.

This is still a work in progress, but I have many ideas for this game.
